A Machine-Learning-Based Direction-of-Origin Filter for the Identification of Radio Frequency Interference in the Search for Technosignatures

## demo.ipynb
In this [notebook](demo.ipynb), we provide the code to replicate the results presented by Pinchuk & Margot (2021). Before continuing, make sure you [download](https://datadryad.org/stash/share/F_HOI2j82AlpiurXS07fAoRXLvG8BwdDy-c42IMIp78) the test data and final model weights and unzip them in the main directory of the repository. 
<br>

The implementation details are spread over four main files:

 - `models.py` 
 - `model_utils.py` 
 - `data_utils.py` 
 - `utils.py`
