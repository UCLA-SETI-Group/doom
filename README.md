In this notebook, we provide the code to replicate the results presented by Pinchuk & Margot (2021). Before continuing, make sure you [download](https://doi.org/10.5068/D17H6P) the test data and final model weights and unzip them in the main directory of the repository.

The implementation details are spread over four main files:

 - `models.py` 
 - `model_utils.py` 
 - `data_utils.py` 
 - `utils.py`
